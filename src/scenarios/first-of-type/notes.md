- will attemp to match every element type 
- will invalidate every element type on mutation of the first element
- does not even matter if it's a different element (i.e. append a span)
- Can also happen if you use react conditional rendering
  - relevant for this because that's what the css should be for
- effect is mirrored for last-of-type
